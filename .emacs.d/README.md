# Emacs configuration

This is my current Emacs configuration.  I started with the configuration
provided by Steve Purcell (https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) and tweaked
it to make it mine.  My changes mostly involve setting up Emacs for
Scala development (scala-mode2 and Ensime) and some minor behavior changes
such as smooth scrolling and my contortionist bindings for buffer
navigation.

## Requirements

* Emacs 23 or greater (note that Emacs 24 is required for some functionality)
